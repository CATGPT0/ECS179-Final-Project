## Gameplay Explanation ##

**In this section, explain how the game should be played. Treat this as a manual within a game. Explaining the button mappings and the most optimal gameplay strategy is encouraged.**

- `W` or `up arrow` key - Move up  
- `A` or `left arrow` key - Move left  
- `S` or `down arrow` key - Move down  
- `D` or `right arrow` key - Move right  
- `E` - Display inventory window  
  - Shows inventory along with a description of what each object is and the effect the object has  
- `H` - Displays window summarizing button mappings
- `tab` - Display current game stats
- Shows health, attack power, speed, armor, current level, and XP
- `Left-click` - Swing sword to attack monsters
  - Does damage in direction the player is facing
  - Must face monster in order to do damage to it

You as the player must navigate through the map and defeat the monsters that attack you. While navigating through the map, you should try to look for treasure chests. These chests contain items that will help you defeat enemies such as health potions, attack potions, defense potions, and swords of varying attack power. You can access these items by pressing `E` on the keyboard. You can look at the bottom left corner of the screen to see your health. If you get killed, selecting `Try Again` will restart the game, and you will start with the stats that you left off on. 

When you find an NPC, `Left-click` on them to begin your interaction. The NPCs give you the option to play a card game against them in order to gain a future combative advantage. ** Insert how to play card game **.


**Add it here if you did work that should be factored into your grade but does not fit easily into the proscribed roles! Please include links to resources and descriptions of game-related material that does not fit into roles here.**

# Main Roles #

Your goal is to relate the work of your role and sub-role in terms of the content of the course. Please look at the role sections below for specific instructions for each role.

Below is a template for you to highlight items of your work. These provide the evidence needed for your work to be evaluated. Try to have at least four such descriptions. They will be assessed on the quality of the underlying system and how they are linked to course content. 

*Short Description* - Long description of your work item that includes how it is relevant to topics discussed in class. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The game's background consists of procedurally generated terrain produced with Perlin noise. The game can modify this terrain at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).

You should replay any **bold text** with your relevant information. Liberally use the template when necessary and appropriate.

## Producer

**Describe the steps you took in your role as producer. Typical items include group scheduling mechanisms, links to meeting notes, descriptions of team logistics problems with their resolution, project organization tools (e.g., timelines, dependency/task tracking, Gantt charts, etc.), and repository management methodology.**

## User Interface and Input

**Describe your user interface and how it relates to gameplay. This can be done via the template.**
**Describe the default input configuration.**

**Add an entry for each platform or input style your project supports.**

## Movement/Physics

**Describe the basics of movement and physics in your game. Is it the standard physics model? What did you change or modify? Did you make your movement scripts that do not use the physics system?**

## Animation and Visuals

**List your assets, including their sources and licenses.**

**Describe how your work intersects with game feel, graphic design, and world-building. Include your visual style guide if one exists.**

## Game Logic

**Document the game states and game data you managed and the design patterns you used to complete your task.**

# Sub-Roles

## Audio

**List your assets, including their sources and licenses.**

**Describe the implementation of your audio system.**

**Document the sound style.** 

## Gameplay Testing

**Add a link to the full results of your gameplay tests.**

**Summarize the key findings from your gameplay tests.**

## Narrative Design

**Document how the narrative is present in the game via assets, gameplay systems, and gameplay.**
